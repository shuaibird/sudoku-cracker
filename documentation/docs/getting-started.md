## About Svelte

 Svelte is a new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.

 Svelte runs at build time, converting your components into pure and optimized JavaScript code without other framework dependencies which makes for really tiny bundles. Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes. So there is no virtual DOM, no frameworks on top of frameworks, and no framework to load at runtime.
 
 The advantages of this approach is we're able to write applications with excellent performance characteristics.
