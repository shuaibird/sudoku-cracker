After starting, an interactive menu will let you configure the component to be created. Firstly, you'll be prompted for a name of the component. Then you'll be asked if you consider adding a style file.

For example, let's go through the steps of the creation of a new page component.

>Enter component name

 - Enter the desired filename for the page. Spaces are not allowed!
 - The tool will check for the existing filenames in the project and reject if finds any.

>Do you want to add a style file?

- If you choose yes, a style.scss file will be created right next to the component.


Eventually, you'll end up with a component with style and test files in no time.
